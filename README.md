# Lit Graphics Module

A simple C++20 OpenGL graphics API.  
I'm creating this project mainly for learning purposes, and to replace [SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/) (which is not very maintained anyway) in my simple lightweight projects, plus generally allow more control over the graphics pipeline.  
  
Trello board of the project can be found [HERE](https://trello.com/b/H3y70DiM/litgraphicsmodule)!
